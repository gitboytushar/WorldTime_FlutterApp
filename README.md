# WorldTime Application

This **project demonstrates** the use of APIs and dynamic UI updates in Flutter, running smoothly on both _Android_ and _iOS_ platforms.

- This application shows the Time fetched from the worldtimeapi in realtime.
- Users can _select different locations_ from a predefined list, and the app _updates the time_ accordingly.
- The _background image changes dynamically_ based on whether it's day or night at the chosen location.
- Tested on real devices and simulators.
- Built with Android Studio as the main IDE.
- The application has it's custom App icon.
- This project is a part of my flutter learning process from youtube playlist.
- I will continue to learn and improve in this field.

## Outcome

- New technologies are explored and learned.
- Gained some basic Experience from development to delivering a Mobile application.
- Learned Android Studio and Apple XCode IDEs while development and simulation.
